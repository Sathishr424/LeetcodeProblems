You are given a string s of length n consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.

You are also given a 2D integer array queries of length q, where each queries[i] is one of the following:


	[1, j]: Flip the character at index j of s i.e. 'A' changes to 'B' (and vice versa). This operation mutates s and affects subsequent queries.
	[2, l, r]: Compute the minimum number of character deletions required to make the substring s[l..r] alternating. This operation does not modify s; the length of s remains n.


A substring is alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. A substring of length 1 is always alternating.

Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the result of the ith query of type [2, l, r].

 
Example 1:


Input: s = "ABA", queries = [[2,1,2],[1,1],[2,0,2]]

Output: [0,2]

Explanation:

Thus, the answer is [0, 2].


Example 2:


Input: s = "ABB", queries = [[2,0,2],[1,2],[2,0,2]]

Output: [1,0]

Thus, the answer is [1, 0].


Example 3:


Input: s = "BABA", queries = [[2,0,3],[1,1],[2,1,3]]

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

Thus, the answer is [0, 1].


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n == s.length <= 105
	s[i] is either 'A' or 'B'.
	1 <= q == queries.length <= 105
	queries[i].length == 2 or 3
	
		queries[i] == [1, j] or,
		queries[i] == [2, l, r]
		0 <= j <= n - 1
		0 <= l <= r <= n - 1
